Front End Engineer Coding Challenge

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, create a functional and stylized Sudoku game. A single board is sufficient (Wikipedia has an example board (see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714.svg) with a solved version (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sudoku-by-L2G-20050714_solution.svg)), but feel free to incorporate a board generator if time permits. 

The purpose of this exercise is to show Uber your ability to architect modular, performant Javascript code with well-structured, flexible CSS.

Make sure your application has an appealing UI, is mobile-friendly (Android/iOS), and supports multiple browsers (latest Firefox/Chrome and IE10). We encourage the use of templating engines and preprocessors, like Jade or Sass, and module loaders like Browserify or RequireJS. You may use JavaScript libraries, like jQuery or Zepto, but please refrain from using frameworks, like Backbone or Bootstrap. You may store state directly in the browser; a server is not required. A build system and tests are a huge plus.

In reviewing, it’s important to us that the code is consistent and well-formatted and that you’ve kept a good commit history that demonstrates your progress. In addition, please provide a README that describes how to run your app, outlines the structure and technologies used, the reasoning behind your technical choices, and any trade-offs you made or changes you would have implemented had you had additional time.

When you’re done, please provide a link to the source on Github or Bitbucket. You’re free to host the game somewhere, like Github Pages (https://pages.github.com/) or 5minfork (http://5minfork.com/), but that’s not required.
